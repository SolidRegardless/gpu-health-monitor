# GitHub Workflows

This directory is reserved for CI/CD workflows.

## Planned Workflows

- **CI**: Run tests, linting, and validation on push/PR
- **Container Build**: Build and push Docker images
- **Documentation**: Auto-generate docs from code
- **Release**: Automated versioning and changelog

Currently, workflows are not implemented. The system is designed for manual deployment via Docker Compose.
